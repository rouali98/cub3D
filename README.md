## Introduction
Welcome to cub3D, your first venture into the world of RayCasting and 3D graphics using miniLibX. This project is inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D and provides a hands-on experience with creating a dynamic view inside a maze.

## Project Description
Cub3D aims to enhance your programming skills in C, algorithms, and graphics design. You will learn about window management, colors, events, and more, while using mathematics to create efficient algorithms.

### Goals
- Implement a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze.
- Utilize Ray-Casting principles for rendering.
- Incorporate smooth window management.
- Display textured walls based on their orientation.
- Set floor and ceiling colors.
- Implement player movement and navigation controls.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) (provided or installed separately)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any C compiler
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cub3D.git
   cd cub3D
   
## Compilation
To compile the project, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

## Usage
To run the program, use a scene description file:

```bash
./cub3D path/to/your/map.cub
```
Explore the maze, look around, and enjoy your 3D adventure!

## Features
Ray-Casting Rendering
Textured Walls
Floor and Ceiling Colors
Smooth Window Management
Player Movement Controls
Map Parsing

## Controls
Arrow keys: Look left and right
W, A, S, D keys: Move within the maze
ESC key: Quit the program

## Scene Description
Customize your scene using a .cub file. Refer to the Common Instructions section in the project description for details on scene description file format.
