## Introduction
Welcome to cub3D, your first venture into the world of RayCasting and 3D graphics using miniLibX. This project is inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D and provides a hands-on experience with creating a dynamic view inside a maze.

## Project Description
Developed as part of [Your School Name]'s [Course Name], cub3D aims to enhance your programming skills in C, algorithms, and graphics design. You will learn about window management, colors, events, and more, while using mathematics to create efficient algorithms.

### Goals
- Implement a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze.
- Utilize Ray-Casting principles for rendering.
- Incorporate smooth window management.
- Display textured walls based on their orientation.
- Set floor and ceiling colors.
- Implement player movement and navigation controls.

## Getting Started
